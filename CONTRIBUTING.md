## Quickstart Guide

Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository**
   - Click on the 'Fork' button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy of this project.

2. **Clone your fork**
   - Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine to start making changes.

3. **Set up your workspace**
   - Make sure your local repository is up to date with the main project (`git pull upstream master` if you've set up an upstream to the original repository).

4. **Create a branch**
   - Create a branch for your changes that succinctly describes the feature or fix you're intending to implement.

5. **Make your changes**
   - Make the necessary changes to the project. Make sure you follow the code style that's established in the project.

6. **Test your changes**
   - Before submitting, make sure your changes do not break any existing functionality. It's also great if you write tests for the new features you're adding.

7. **Commit your changes**
   - Commit your changes with a clear commit message that explains what you've done.

8. **Push to your fork**
   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

9. **Submit a pull request**
   - Open a pull request to the main project, fill in the provided PR template, and wait for feedback.

## General Guidelines

- Ensure your code is well-documented.
- If you're adding new features, please also update the documentation.
- Keep your commits as small as possible; one commit should concern one topic.
- Write detailed commit messages that make it clear what changes have been made and why.
- Do not add any types of `log` files, temp files, or IDE-specific files to your commit unless they are absolutely necessary.

## Pull Request Process

- Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We welcome your pull requests:
  1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
  2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
  3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
  4. Ensure your code lints.
  5. Issue the pull request.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and understanding.
- Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at an event hosted by our project, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a project maintainer or community member makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures included in this document.

Remember, contributions to this project should follow our community values and respect [the GNU General Public License](LICENSE.md).

We're excited to see your creative ideas and contributions to the Dark and Darker Trading Bot community!

Thank you, and happy coding!
